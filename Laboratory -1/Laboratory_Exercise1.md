VIVA QUESTIONS:
1. Define signal, Give Examples for 1-D, 2-D, 3-D signals.
* Signal: A signal is a function that conveys information about the behavior or attributes of some phenomenon.

* 1-D signal: Depends on one variable (e.g., audio signal as a function of time).

* 2-D signal: Depends on two variables (e.g., image as a function of x and y coordinates).

* 3-D signal: Depends on three variables (e.g., video or 3D medical scans over space and time).

2. Define transform. What is the need for transform?
* Transform: A mathematical technique that converts a signal from one domain to another (e.g., time to frequency).
  
3. Differentiate Fourier transform and discrete Fourier transform.
* The Fourier Transform analyzes continuous signals and gives a continuous frequency spectrum. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) works on sampled (discrete) signals and provides a finite set of frequency components, making it suitable for digital systems.

4. Differentiate DFT and DTFT
* The DTFT applies to infinite-length sequences and gives a continuous spectrum. The DFT is used for finite-length sequences and gives a discrete spectrumâ€”ideal for computation and real-world digital signal processing.

5. Explain mathematical formula for calculation of DFT.

* It transforms a time-domain signal x(n)x(n) into its frequency-domain form X(k)X(k), using complex exponentials as basis functions.   

6. Explain mathematical formula for calculation of IDFT.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdfab41f-ac6a-461c-9b39-6576ee0d6d2a)

* It reconstructs the original signal from its frequency components by reversing the DFT process.
7. How to calculate FT for 1-D signal?

* This expresses the signal in terms of its frequency content.

8. What is meant by magnitude plot, phase plot, power spectrum?
* Magnitude plot: Shows frequency strength.

* Phase plot: Shows the phase shift of each frequency.

* Power spectrum: Shows energy at each frequency, calculated as ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/874359b9-ee75-44fa-a3f1-8a27da0347d7)

9. Explain the applications of DFT.
* DFT is used in audio and image processing, communication systems (like 4G/5G), biomedical signal analysis, and spectrum analysis, helping extract frequency information and enable compression/filtering.
      
10. What are separable transforms?
*Separable transforms allow multi-dimensional processing by applying 1D transforms separately on rows and columns. They're widely used in image and video processing (e.g., 2D DFT, DCT).
